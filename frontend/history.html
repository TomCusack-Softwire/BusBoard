<h2> Invention </h2>
<p>
    In 1829, the only road vehicles were <i>hackneys</i> (horse-drawn carriages which have since been motorised to <i>taxis</i>).
    George Shillibeer looked to change this, so created the <b>Omnibus</b> (Latin: 'for all').

<p>
    Initially, he was refused permission to run the Omnibus in Central London (due to licencing regulations), so the first routes were around the edge of London: from Paddington to Islington to the City of London.

<p>
    When this restriction was lifted in 1832, other operators introduced Omnibus services.
    At this time, there were approximately 400 horse-powered buses in London.
    The largest service was the London General Omnibus Company, which took over the majority of Omnibuses by 1856.
</p>
<p>
    However, during World War One, smaller companies competed against the Omnibuses, causing recklessness on the roads and making London
    nationalise the buses. 'London Transport' became the entity that controlled traffic in London.
</p>
<p>
    By 1994, London privatised 'London Transport', and in 2000 the management of the buses moved to the Mayor of London's transport organisation,
    'Transport for London', which still controls the buses to this day.
</p>
<h2> Current buses </h2>
<p>
    According to Wikipedia, as of 2021, there are 675 bus routes in London which are serviced by 9065 buses (including 3884 hybrids, 485 electric and 2 hydrogen buses).
    Almost all of these are operated privately but contracted to do so by Transport For London.
